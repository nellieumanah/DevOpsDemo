## DevOps Demo App

To get started, you will need to install NodeJS (which in turn install Node Package Manager/NPM).
 - See: https://nodejs.org/

Once you have that, you can install this app's packages. In a terminal:
```
npm i
```

Then you can run the app:
```
npm start
```

*Note:* Alternatively, you can us `node main.js` to start the app. 

You should see a message like:
```
DevOps Demo App Running. Visit: http://localhost:3000 is running locally, or http://[ server IP]:3000 if on a server.
```

Open a browser, and visit the URL. 

*Note: You can specify the port used by setting the PORT environment variable.*
